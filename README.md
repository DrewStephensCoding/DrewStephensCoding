### Hi There 👋 I'm Drew!

I'm passionate about self-teaching android development and working on apps in my free time!
At work, I'm an aircraft mechanic on the Lockheed Martin C-130J for the U.S Air Force <br />
I'm also a dad of 4 awesome kids! My life is full of adventure and making the best of it
