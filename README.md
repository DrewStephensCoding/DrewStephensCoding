### Hi There 👋 I'm Drew!

I'm passionate about learning android development and working on apps in my free time!
At work, I'm an aircraft mechanic on the Lockheed Martin C-130J for the U.S Air Force <br />
I'm also a superhero dad to 4 amazing kids and my wife Rebecca. <br />
My life is full of adventure and making the best of it!
